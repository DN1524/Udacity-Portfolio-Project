- Hero image is a picture taken of the the HTML code from the HomeTown project with my phone.
- Page should be responsive to phone screen sizes to desktop screens.
- Was planning on making a nav bar, but I was not sure how similar my page should be compared to the mockup.
- The colors #02b3e4, #7d97ad, #2d3c49, are not mine. They are colors given in the Udacity Mockup PDF.
